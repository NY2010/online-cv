    - role: Head of Product 
      time: 2012 - 2014
      company: Cerebriam Technology, London
      details: |
        Having worked closely with the lead product engineer for three years, I was able to rapidly develop two prototypes 
        using two different hardware platforms in order to test the companyâ€™s software applications. Software application 
        test sprints were organised to identify the best development platform in terms of performance and functionality. 
        The chosen platform then went through a phase of production engineering and cost accounting to ensure the highest 
        quality product would be manufactured in an efficient manner, and an optimised bill of materials.

        Specific tasks include: hardware specifications, finding suppliers, supplier due diligence, review of supplier logistics, 
        optimising bill of materials, hardware prototyping, user centered design consultations, product chassis design, 
        mechanical design, compiling build environment on Linux.
